# Object-Oriented Programming in Python

This repository serves as a guide to understanding the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. At the heart of OOP lies the ability to create programs around classes and objects. Throughout this guide, we will delve into various aspects of OOP using Python as our primary language.

## Introduction

At the forefront of any language classified as an OOP language, there must exist the ability to create programs around classes and objects. We have already started working with these concepts earlier as we built our own custom classes, class methods, and instance objects. 

## Example

To recap, let‚Äôs take a look at an example:

```python
class Dog:
  sound = "Woof"

  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def bark(self):
    print(Dog.sound)
```

In the above example, we are representing a real-world entity (a dog) as a class with properties (name and age) and methods (bark). These features make up the core of the OOP paradigm and ultimately allow us to build more intricate programs.

## Core Pillars of OOP

This however only scratches the surface of what we can accomplish. To explore the paradigm further, we will examine the four core pillars of OOP:

1. **Inheritance**
2. **Polymorphism**
3. **Abstraction**
4. **Encapsulation**

Each of these pillars will allow us to expand our skills so that we can take full advantage of the power of object-oriented programming in Python!
